Grade: 82.5/100 
The structure of game is in place, there are enough levels, assets and gameplay elements. I think that the major areas for improvement are the challenges posed to the player (i) and making the graphics more reponsive and coherent with the gameplay (ii). (i) The ghosts should be chasing the player if seen in the cone of vision, but it didnâ€™t seem to really happen, rendering the hiding mechanic hard to find useful. Either the event criteria should be tweaked or more elements (e.g. action sound effects) could be used to increase the likelihood of being detected. (ii) Minor improvements to the graphic effects would go a long way in making the game feel polished. I found the visibility radius limited and together with a very dark color palette it was very hard to get a feel of the environment the player is able to move in. The work distribution between members could also be improved as it seems that some members have been working on a single aspect of the game from the very first milestone and were out of place when asked to move around the codebase. 

## Milestone Requirements (57.75):
+7.5/15 Geometry: The triangle implementation in the shader is per-se worth more than rendering a simple triangle, but it is not more complex than sprites. 
+10/20 Collisions: The collision detection method still uses the approximate naive shapes
+15/15 Physics: Momentum-based torch throwing
+15/15 Non-linear motion: Catmull-Rom splines
+10/10 Stable game code

## Milestone creative (25/100):
+ 10 Shader supporting multiple lights
+ 10 Sound effects and Music
+ 5 Torches interact with the environment and light up upon collision with flames

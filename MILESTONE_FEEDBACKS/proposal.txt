Team 5 GRADE 80

-5 The core physics requirement is not satisfied
-5 Unclear/undeveloped sentences: Abrupt end to movement/2D skeletal animations
-5 Lack of details and content in the advanced technical elements
-5 Development plan is too generic

The features to be implemented in the game are in line with the expectations and requirements, but the proposal itself could have benefit from more in-depth details and examples to help up 
In the core technical features, what you are describing is the lack of physic-based controls, we are not sure what your plans are for this technical requirement.
There also seems to be some overlap between the Geometry and Physics components of the project, they both mention collision detection and inverse square falloff would be more appropriate as a rendering feature (~ softer shadows).
The development plan is also scarce, the subdivision should have been fine-grained enough to get an idea of what each member could have worked on during each week (without necessarily have explicit assignments).
